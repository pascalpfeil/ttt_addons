# TTT addons

This repository contains the source code for some addons I made back in 2016-2017 for the [TTT](https://www.troubleinterroristtown.com/) game mode for [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/).

## [TTT Advanced Disguiser](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610632051)

<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610632051"><img src="ttt_advanced_disguiser\icon\addon_icon.jpg" width="200"></a>

__This addon allows a traitor to steal another player's identity.__  

This is a modified version of a known addon where I added some `convar`s, implemented player skin stealing and made a custom view- and worldmodel.

## [TTT Toxin Pack](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609007212)

<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609007212"><img src="ttt_toxin_pack\icon\addon_icon.jpg" width="200"></a>

__This addon adds a Hemotoxin Gun and a Spazmax Gun for traitors. The Hemotoxin Gun deal damage, while the Spazmax Gun makes the victim do funny things. There is an antidote for the detectives, though.__  

This is a tweaked version of some of [TFlippy](https://github.com/TFlippy)'s weapons where I made a custom view- and worldmodel and tweaked some parameters to balance the weapons.

__This addon allows a traitor to remote control other players.__   

I made this addon from scratch, including a custom viewmodel with animations in blender.
